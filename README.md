# Responsive-Email-Templates

This project started as a way to help a client who wanted to wade into the world of email newsletters. She also has multiple staff
who send email correspondences and wanted to keep the look, feel and voice of her company in tact by creating reusable templates to help
execute various workflows.

Because most of her teachers use Apple Mail and she didn't necessarily want to purchase a subscription to a service like MailChimp we
thought a great way to solve her problem would be to create HTML templates that are packaged using the Apple Mail Stationery container.

Using this method I could keep her formatting in tact by using the CONTENTEDITABLE attribute where editing is permitted. Another benefit
of this was distributing the files was made very easy as .stationery files are executable, so they install in the proper directory once
opened and can then be archived or discarded, with the new template available in the Stationery window within Apple Mail. 

Additionally, the HTML could be imported to a service like MailChimp and it shouldn't have any problem recognizing the code.
